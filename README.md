=============

Project for the 2013/2014 winter session of Procedural and logic programming

Write an ANSI C program that gets from the keyboard two propositional logic formulas and
establishes whether they are equivalent. For the sake of simplicity, each formula can contain at
most three occurrences of logical connectives (not, or, and, if-then, i), which can be represented
as single decimal digits. As a consequence, the formula can contain at most four occurrences of
propositions, which can be represented as single letters. Each formula must not contain parentheses,
thus it is necessary to apply precedence and associativity rules.

The whole program is licensed under the terms of gpl v3 or later, except for the assaigment.
